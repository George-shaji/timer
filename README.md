# BucketList Frontend

A simple Vue.js application with Docker support.

## Storage Configuration

This application uses **Google Sheets only** for data storage. LocalStorage has been completely removed.

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ **Read Operations**: Can read timer data from Google Sheets
- ‚ùå **Write Operations**: Requires additional setup (see `GOOGLE_SHEETS_WRITE_SETUP.md`)

### Quick Setup for Write Operations:
1. See `GOOGLE_SHEETS_WRITE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
2. Option 1: Google Apps Script Web App (recommended)
3. Option 2: Service Account authentication

### Data Flow:
- All timer sessions are stored in Google Sheets
- Data persists across devices and browser sessions
- CSV export comes directly from Google Sheets
- No local storage dependencies

```bash
# Build and run the production container
npm run docker:prod

# Or manually:
